    <h3 class="post-title">Studying Data Science</h3>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>
     I'm pretty much the same with my wife when it comes to passion. I never wanted to studying in electrical engineering at the first place.
     However, I took it anyway because I think the electrical engineering major is quite versatile where I can be flexible to take any pathway for my master degree.
     </p>
     <p>
       I always have a passion in music and data science, therefore audio engineering and data science are two majors that I considered to take after graduated.
       I ended up taking Data Science in <span><em><strong><a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a></strong></em></span>, Melbourne, considering that the knowledge in this area is still rarely possessed.
       That will be an extraordinary opportunity for me to own such knowledge in the future.

   <h3 class="post-title">Studying Art</h3>
   <div class="post-content">
     <p>
    When I was in highschool I always wanted to be an artist but nobody really believed in me.
    I ended up going to a law school for four years, but I still realize
    that my life hasn't satisfied me if I don't try to pursue my dream as an artist one day.
    After five years graduating from Law School, I finally decide to pursue my art diploma this year in
    <span><em><strong><a href="https://www.latrobecollege.com.au/">La Trobe College Melbourne</a></strong></em></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
    After I discussed with my psychologist and took a talent test, I went to my parents and showed them the result.
    That's the turning point where I suddenly got a confidence and bravery to take a leap of faith in changing my career direction.
